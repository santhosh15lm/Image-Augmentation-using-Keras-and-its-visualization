# Image-Augmentation-using-Keras-and-its-visualization
Data augmentation is one of the most useful task to be done when we have little or less amount of data for training our network. Thus i present ways to do increase your dataset size by applying the concept of data augmentation using keras. Techniques covered under this experiment are Rotation, Zooming, Flipping vertically and horizontally, shifting images horizontally and vertically, ZCA whitening and feature standardization. This experiment includes visualization of the dataset after applying various augmentation techniques for better understanding of what these techniques actually do.
